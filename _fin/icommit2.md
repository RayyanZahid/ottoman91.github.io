**The Context**
{: .text-center}

In Sierra Leone, 70% of the labour force is engaged in subsistence farming. 
However,the persistence of low productivity leads to the farmers dealing with
uncertain cash flows in their every day lives. This in turn affects their 
ability to save for buying input materials at the growing season, thereby 
affecting their economic standing and food security.

**The Solution**
{: .text-center}

iCommit is a mobile money based conditional cash savings 
scheme that allows farmers to buy agricultural inputs at harvest time for the 
next growing season. 

With iCommit, transactions are conducted via a USSD menu linked to an individual's
mobile money account. The farmer would pay with mobile money at harvest time 
and collect the input at the next growing season by sending his iCommit voucher
to the input seller.

Since farmers have the greatest amount of cash flow at the harvesting season, 
iCommit would allow them to "commit" to buying the inputs at the harvest time in
advance. Until the next growing season, they would be saving money in their
mobile money accounts.

**Research Evidence for iCommit**
{: .text-center}

iCommit is based on an academic article published by Esther Dufflo, M Kremer 
and Robinson in the American Economic Review (Duflo et. al 2011). The researchers
tested the impact of offering small scale maize farmers in Busia district of   
Western Kenya to buy in advance at harvest time fertilisers for the next growing
season with free delivery. Forty percent of the farmers who were offered the option
to buy in advance did. In the same experiment, Duflo compared the impact on fertiliser
use with another group of maize farmers who were offered to buy fertilisers at 
subsidised prices during the growing season. The impact of offering to buy in   
advance was equivalent to a 50% subsidy on fertiliser price.

**The Value Proposition**
{: .text-center}

A multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to digitize the payment system of the 
agricultural input supply chain, and increases modern agricultural input use 
and the penetration of mobile financial services in the rural areas.

**The Next Steps**

iCommit is currently being funded by the United Nations Capital Development
Fund(UNCDF) for a country-wide beta run. Before departing from Sierra Leone, I 
completed the first design sprint for unearthing findings that were then used 
for structuring the pilot of the platform. The report can be accessed
