**Background Information**
{: .text-center}

UNCDF is partnering the Bank of Sierra Leone and the Office of the Accountant 
General at the Ministry of Finance for the planning and implementation of the 
National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2017 â€“ 2020 under Digital Financial 
Services (DFS). The Strategy identifies an opportunity to leverage the volume 
of government salary payments to build a business case for DFS, thereby 
expanding access points and ultimately the availability of a wide range of 
financial services to underserved communities

**The Scope**
{: .text-center}

Of the total 80,000 government employees who receive their salaries in their 
bank accounts, at least 50% recipients are based in rural and hard to reach 
areas where there is limited or no banking infrastructure. These recipients 
have to travel long distances to district capitals, to check if their salaries 
have been deposited and most of them withdraw their salary in full to avoid 
having to undertake the ordeal of visiting the bank multiple times. The 
assignment is to collect data on the financial lives of government employees, 
particularly those based in rural areas. The survey will focus on information 
related to their socio-economic profile, financial assets and services, f
inancial behavior including savings, investments and credit behavior, 
consumer perception about DFS and insurance solutions.
