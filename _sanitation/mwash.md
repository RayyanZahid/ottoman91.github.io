*This project was implemented while I was working as the Country Manager at [Code for Sierra Leone](https://codeforsierraleone.org).* 
*It is one of the 3 projects across Sub Saharan Africa currently being supported by the [Engine Room](https://www.theengineroom.org/) under its [Matchbox Program](https://www.theengineroom.org/welcoming-our-new-sub-saharan-africa-partners-to-the-matchbox-program/)*

**About the Project**
{: .text-center}

MWash aims to bridge the information and communication gap related to water 
sanitation and health between the government and the people. It provides users 
with an interactive access to data related to the locations of water and 
sanitation points in Freetown via a web application. It would also enable the 
citizens to submit updated information related to the water and 
sanitation points in their own localities via an SMS service that would be 
linked with the main application. This way, it would improve the 
transparency in critical water and sanitation information sharing between the 
consumers, the utilities providers and the elected officials.


**The Objectives of the Platform**
{: .text-center}

1. To provide information about basic facilities in ensuring the provision of safe drinking water for citizens in Sierra Leone

2. Improve on information dissemination on sanitation and hygiene in the country especially slums and riverine communities

3. To use technology (in the form of a mobile app and a scaleable web app) to improve on information about water and sanitation at community level.
