*This project was completed for the 2014 Unilever Talent Hunt Business 
Plan Competition.It was the winner in the PureIt brand category and one of the
six finalist ideas submitted to the senior management team of Unilever Pakistan.
The project was also featured by [+Acumen](http://www.plusacumen.org/journal/computer-engineers-unlikely-impact-journey-pakistan-sierra-leone)*


**The Scope of the Project**
{: .text-center}

To devise a 360 degree marketing plan for PureIt, a water purification system 
catered for low income families from Karachi and Lahore



**The Status of Potable Water in Pakistan**
{: .text-center}

Approximately 15.9 million people in Pakistan do not have access to safe 
drinking water. With more than 200,000 children dying due to water borne 
diseases annually, there is an urgent need for a hassle free, cheap and safe 
option for accessing potable water 

**A Viable Solution - PureIt Excella**
{: .text-center}

PureIt is an affordable solution that, if marketed effectively,
can provide potable water to vulnerable communities in the country. The water
purifier does not require electricity or gas to operate, and provides safe, 
drinkable water at a cost of Rs 1 (US $ 0.01) per litre.

**Current Status of PureIt in the Consumer Market in Pakistan**
{: .text-center} 

To date, PureIt has been unable to gain traction in the Pakistani  
market. The following are the two major reasons for this: 

1. The lack of incentives for customers to shift from the status quo of using 
traditional methods like boiling water to buying a water purifier.

2. Trust in the workability of PureIt as an efficient water purifier.

Unilever’s current modus operandi for marketing and selling Pureit is not 
effective. Sales representatives known as Pureit Water Experts(PWEs) are 
responsible for listing the potential advantages of PureIt to customers at 
supermarkets. There is a need for establishing a personalized connection with 
the target market, since a structural shift of opinion about the workability and 
advantages of a water purification system needs to be cultivated.

**Benchmarking Pureit’s Current Implementation in Pakistan with India**
{: .text-center} 

In India,PureIt is one of Unilever's most successful products. Hindustan Unilever
digitized the distribution networks of Pureit via a well maintained online delivery 
and service portal. The adaption of the product was entirely community driven, 
and endorsements from the health authorities eased Pureit’s acceptance amongst the 
consumers.

In comparison, interaction between the product and the customer is missing in 
Pakistan. The Pureit website is outdated and low in User Experience (UX), 
while the customer service leaves much to be desired. 

**Output From the Design Thinking Exercises**
{: .text-center} 

The team decided to implemented human centered design (HCD) methodologies
to develop the marketing plan for PureIt. A major reason for this was the 
fact that a successful adoption of the product required a much deeper understanding
of the end users, and any solution had to be community driven.

The team engaged in multiple ethnographic studies, interviews and framework mapping exercises
in order to understand how best to market the product within urban low income
families in Lahore and Karachi. The following was the major output from the 
design thinking exercise.

**Target Customer Analysis**

The following was a persona of the typical PureIt customer.

As highlighted by the persona, the basic consumer need was of a cheap, hassle-free
and time saving method for obtaining healthy water.

**Value Proposition Chart**

addressing for the customers

**The Basic Insights Behind The Marketing Plan**
{: .text-center} 

The community in the target group(TG) is the main catalyst for our marketing 
campaign. We need a more intrinsic, personalized interaction with our TG, 
hence we need to use internal stakeholders i.e. existing PureIt customers chosen
as Pureit ambassadors, and Unilever employees in the communities chosen as 
Pureit agents. Also, there should be endorsements from doctors and local health
officials on the workability of the product.


**The Central Idea of the Marketing Strategy**
{: .text-center}

The central idea of the marketing strategy was the *Share Water, Create Happiness Campaign*.
Under the campaign, the following two activities were recommended:

* **The Purepoints referral program.**
A continuous incentivising program which aimed to encourage the adoption of 
the product. Since customers in Pakistan were more aware about other Unilever 
products generally, the idea was to offer them discounts on other popular household 
Unilever products via regular usage of PureIt as well as by referring new 
customers to use the product.The insight behind this program was that the 
customers would be more influenced after watching their neighbours, relatives, 
friends etc. use the product, rather than being convinced about the usability 
of the product from mere sales representatives.

* **The "Saaf Paani, Saaf Samajh" ( Clean Water, Clean Community) Campaign.** 
Access to potable water is a serious issue for communities in Pakistan. It was
therefore recommended to launch a community service initiative, under which 
cleanliness drives were launched in local communities. These drives were 
augmented by endorsements from local doctors on both,the urgent need of ensuring
that family members drink clean water, and also on the workability of PureIt.


**The Recommended Distribution Network**
