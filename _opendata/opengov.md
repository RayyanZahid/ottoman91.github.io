**Background**
{: .text-center}

Over the past few years, African governments have enthusiastically jumped onto 
the tech revolution that is gradually sweeping across the continent, working in
collaboration with the civic tech community to create tools that enhance the 
interaction between the citizenry and the government.


**The Sierra Leone Open Gov Fellowship**
{: .text-center}

Code for Sierra Leone, in partnership with Code for Africa and the World Bank,
launched the Sierra Leone Open Government Fellowship. This Fellowship gives 
outstanding change makers the skills, tools and resources necessary to help 
the Sierra Leone government adopt tech tools to become more engaging with its 
citizens. 

Over the course of six months, each Open Government Fellow will be embedded in 
a specific government ministry and work with them to make their activities more
open to the general public.
