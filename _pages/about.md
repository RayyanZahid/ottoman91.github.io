An bibliophile, coder, amateur photographer, avid learner. I am currently working on tech based projects in the development sector in Sierra Leone, and am always on the lookout for projects that use human centered design, data science and open source technologies to try and solve some less glamorous but pressing problems that the people at the bottom of the pyramid face on a daily basis.
