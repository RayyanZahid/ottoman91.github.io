I am a computer engineering graduate, currently working in the information, communication
and technology for development (ICTD) space in Sierra Leone and Liberia at [iDT Labs](https://idtlabs.xyz), an award winning
tech for development startup that uses technology to augment socio-economic change in West Africa. I am also 
the country manager for [Code for Sierra Leone](https://codeforsierraleone.org), an civic tech organization that uses
open source technology to improve the delivery of services in the public sector.

I am passionate about using human centered design in tandem with technology to
create products and services that aim to solve some of the most pressing issues in the 
third world. My interest lies in ehealth, open government and financial inclusion. 

In all of my projects, I bring along a strong set of programming skills in open
source technology, but specifically in Python, R and Java. I have also
extensively utilized human centered design in the ideation of projects primarily in 
healthcare and financial inclusion. Moreover, as the Country Manager of Code
for Sierra Leone, I actively engage with developer partners, donors, and other
civic tech organizations in West Africa. I also have experience of conducting
research in the open data and financial inclusion space in the region.
