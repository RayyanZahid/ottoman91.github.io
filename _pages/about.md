I'm a Masters Candidate in Stanford's [Design](http://designimpact.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} program, with a focus on using data science and human-centered design principles to improve healthcare products and services. I'm currently researching in the [Human Computer Interaction(HCI)](https://hci.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} group under [James Landay](https://www.landay.org/){:target="_blank"} on building physical and digital adaptations that enhance sustainability and human well-being.

This past summer, I interned as a User Researcher at [Verily Life Sciences](https://verily.com/){:target="_blank"} on building a care pathway to efficiently identify, diagnose, treat and manage individuals with sleep apnea.

Before this,I worked in the information, communication and technology for development (ICTD) space in West Africa, particularly in Sierra Leone and Liberia on projects in the **healthcare**, **open government** and **financial
inclusion** sectors. I was also the Country Manager for [Code for Sierra Leone](https://codeforsierraleone.org){:target="_blank"}, a civic tech organization that
uses open source technology to improve the delivery of services in the public sector.
