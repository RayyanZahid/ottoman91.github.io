I am an ardent bibliophile, never the one to not buy a book from a book store
(notwithstanding the number of unread books in my library back home). 
Science fiction, history, 
philosophy and economics are some of my favourite genres. 

My most fruitful year of reading was in 2016, when I had to call it a day after
reading 86 out of the intended goal of 100 books due to an eye condition. Here
is the list of books that I read then:

Reviewed below are some books that have influenced my thinking in one way or 
another. I do plan on expanding on this space in the future.
