I organized and facilitated a [design thinking workshop](http://designimpact.stanford.edu/bootcamp/) for approximately 50 mid-career professionals at the Stanford d school.
With keynote speeches from David Kelley and Michael Barry, the workshop aimed to give a general introduction on design thinking and to inspire the participants to adopt design thinking 
in their daily lives. 

The participants were led through the [Wallet Project](https://dschool-old.stanford.edu/groups/designresources/wiki/4dbb2/the_wallet_project.html),
a full cycle design project in which they ideate and make a prototype of a "meaningful" wallet for their partners.
