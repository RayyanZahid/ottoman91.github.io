As part of my Design and Manufacture class at Stanford, I decided to create an heirloom for my wife and I,something which we would be able to hopefully pass onto our future generations.

Living abroad since the past several years, both of us do not have a lot of memoribilia from back home. With Virasat, I wanted to create something simple and elegant that would be a reflection of our identity.
In the immediate future, the heirloom would be used as a jewellery box by my wife ( hopefully!)
