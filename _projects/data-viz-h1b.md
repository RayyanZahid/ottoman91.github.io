This data vizualization app was built while followig Swizec Teller's
excellent React+d3.js book, which I highly recommend to anyone interested in
learning how to build cool visualizations via React and d3.js. The app
displays a spatial distribution of areas in the USA which pay the highest for 
different tech jobs that are available for H1B visa holders. The data can be 
filtered based on years between 2012-2016, and can also be filtered via the 
different categories of jobs available as well as on a state level. 
The app also displays a histogram that categorises the distribution of tech
salaries in a specific state or across the country compared to median household
income, which is a good proxy for cost of living.
