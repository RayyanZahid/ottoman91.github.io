I worked with the Systems Utilization Research for Stanford Medicine(SURF) Lab on developing
an algorithm that could help the Lucille Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford(LPCH)
with automating the process of implemeting target based care.

Over the last few years, LCPH has been creating surgical patient cohorts. Specifically, the hospital was able to create cohorts with specific target lengths of stay for pacemaker surgeries, Aortic valve repair, Mitral valve repair, and other cardiovascular procedures. Target based care is incredibly important as it allows for both better clinical workflow design and provides information to the patients about what they should expect during their stay. Our goal throughout this project was to automate the process of creating these cohorts to make it faster and less manually intensive.
