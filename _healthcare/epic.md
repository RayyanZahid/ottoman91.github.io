*The pilot and proof of concept of an infectious disease surveillance and community 
response system across all public health units in the district of Port Loko, 
Sierra Leone. The platform was developed by IBM Research Africa for the USAID 
[Ebola Grant Challenge](http://www.ebolagrandchallenge.net/innovations-3/)*

*This project was implemented while I was working as the Research and Developer
 lead at [iDT Labs](https://idtlabs.xyz). For further information about this 
 project please email info@idtlabs.xyz*


**The Context**
{: .text-center}

The Ebola outbreak of 2014 in Sierra Leone highlighted how there was an absence
of a proper mechanism between the Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) and
its partner organizations for the sharing of important datasets that were 
imperative to understanding and fighting the spread of the epidemic. Instead, 
these datasets were often constrained in their silos, leading to extreme 
inefficiencies in the collection and analysis of critical health data, which 
had a negative impact that permeated downstream to the frontline response to 
the epidemic.

**The Solution**
{: .text-center}

The Epidemic Preparedness in Communities (EPiC) platform was built by IBM 
Research Africa to support heath sector stakeholders with data-driven tools for
aiding evidence-based decision making during the post-Ebola recovery efforts 
in the healthcare sector in Sierra Leone. By leveraging a data-driven platform 
that provided strong data analytics and visualisation tools from a single, 
intuitive dashboard, the aim of EPiC was to help the MoHS, along 
with the other stakeholders and partners to utilise a data-driven process of 
tracking and preventing the spread of infectious disease in their communities.

This platform would enable health administrators to quickly identify which 
health facilities and regions required urgent assistance using both formal 
health management records and community feedback. 

**The Scope of the Pilot**
{: .text-center}

iDT Labs was contracted by IBM Research Africa to implement a one month proof 
of concept exercise at the offices of the district health medical team at Port 
Loko and the Open Government Initiative (OGI) at Freetown to conduct the following 
activities:

* Map out the technical capacity for all organizations and users in the 
stakeholder group, including infrastructure (e.g., hardware and connectivity),
systems (e.g. current Health Information Systems in place) and human resource 
capacity (technical abilities of potential users).

* Provide training for the initial users of EPiC during the proof of concept 
phase

* Map out the current workflows for the use of data in disease surveillance in 
Sierra Leone to form baseline for Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) assessment

**The Methodology**
{: .text-center}

The following officers from the DHMT at Port Loko participated in the pilot: 

* District medical officer

* Data analysts supporting the district medical officer

* Infectious disease and health surveillance officers

* Monitoring and evaluation officers

The purpose of the pilot training at the DHMT was to help participants 
understand the system and how data driven surveillance and interventions can 
lead to substantial efficiency gains. The training was also divided into 
three main portions that were designed to transition the users through the 
following three stages

**Data Flow of the System**

The following is the diagrammatic representation mapped out on how the existing data 
flows should ideally integrate with the disease surveillance and community 
response dashboards of EPiC.

**Key Insights From the Pilot**
{: .text-center}   

The following were they key insights that were gained from the pilot, which 
are relevant for any data driven initiative that is aimed at improving the 
service delivery of a critical public sector entity in a post conflict economy such
as that of Sierra Leone. 

1.*Data visualization and intelligence is the end product of a value chain
that involves several pre-requisite activities, and any data visualization tool
should support this entire value chain* 

Although the data intelligence and visualisation functionalities related to 
disease surveillance would greatly help any under funded national health unit, 
data visualisation is in fact a minor component in the chain of activities 
carried out by surveillance officers. The system should provide the users with 
functionalities for directly uploading, verifying and sharing the raw data that
is used to generate intelligence and reports by the platform. 

2.*A strong stakeholder engagement strategy is critical for the successful
adoption of any technological intervention in the public sector* 

For the successful, eventual roll out of any national disease surveillance system 
, stakeholder buy-in is of utmost importance. Over the course of the trainings 
conducted at the DHMT, low priority was afforded to the exercise by the top 
management of the DHMT and GOAL, with individuals dedicated to the exercise 
being low-level employees with limited understanding of the entire value chain 
of infectious disease surveillance that EPIC aims to support.Given the alarming
rate of failed technological interventions in post conflict countries such as 
Sierra Leone, effective user adoption is by far the biggest risk to the long 
term survival of the platform.

3.*Downloadable, printable copies of reports is important in a “paper based” 
low digital literacy context like Sierra Leone*

Owing to the “paper based” culture that is prevalent across governmental 
departments in developing countries, any system must allow for easy printing 
of all reports generated by the users.
