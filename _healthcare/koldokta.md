*Streamlining the delivery of affordable healthcare via an interactive voice response based system in Sierra Leone.*

*This research was conducted while I was working as the Research and Developer lead at [iDT Labs](https://idtlabs.xyz){:target="_blank"}. For further 
information about this project please email info@idtlabs.xyz*

**Background**
{: .text-center}

Sierra Leone has one of the poorest healthcare systems in the world, as highlighted by the following facts:

</figure> 

However, efforts for improving healthcare have not resulted in 
a long-term, permanent improvement, with the general global efforts in the field
primarily focused towards "disease specific funding".

Instead, investments need to be made in improving the healthcare infrastructure 
and in streamlining the delivery of healthcare in the country.  

**A Possible Solution**
{: .text-center} 

Sierra Leone has a mobile penetration rate of 44%. One possible solution for improving
access to healthcare is of introducing a nation-wide mobile based healthcare intervention system. 

**The Value Proposition**
{: .text-center}   

*Streamlining affordable and quality medical services for the common Sierra 
Leonean via a mobile based healthcare platform.* 

**The Human Centered Design Approach Undertaken**
{: .text-center}   

Interviews were conducted with common people and medical care practitioners in
Freetown to better understand their challenges and the feasiblity of a mobile
based healthcare intervention system.

**Output From The Design Research**
{: .text-center}    

Based on the results from the design research, the following two tools were constructed:

* **The Evidence Planning Toolkit**. Highlighting the replacements, enhancements 
and potential hazards of the mobile based healthcare delivery platform. 

* **The Business Model Canvas** - Charting out the various facets of the business model for Kol Dokta.

**The Next Steps**
{: .text-center}    

A working prototype for Kol Dokta was developed on the [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/){:target="_blank"}
open source communication framework. The prototype was initially available
in Krio, which is the most popular regional language in Sierra Leone for running
the pilot of the project in Freetown over a period of six months in 2015.
