{% include base_path %}

I'm currently a Masters Candidate in Stanford's [Design](http://designimpact.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"} program.

Before this,I worked in the information, communication and technology for development (ICTD) space in West Africa, particularly in Sierra Leone and Liberia on projects in the **healthcare**, **open government** and **financial
inclusion** sectors. I was also the Country Manager for [Code for Sierra Leone](https://codeforsierraleone.org){:target="_blank"}, a civic tech organization that
uses open source technology to improve the delivery of services in the public sector.

I am passionate about using human centered design in tandem with technology to
create products and services that aim to solve some of the most pressing issues in the
third world. At Stanford, my research focus is on using AI, machine learning and design thinking for social impact.
