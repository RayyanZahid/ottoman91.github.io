*This project was implemented while I was working as the Country Manager at [Code for Sierra Leone](https://codeforsierraleone.org){:target="_blank"}*

**About the Project**
{: .text-center}

Know Your City is a web based tool that aims to map out all infrastructure facilities available in the
informal settlements in Freetown. By mapping out hazard areas prone to flooding
and other natural disasters, the project aims to make this vital information
publicly available, so that the relevant stakeholders can put pressure on the
government to work toward speedy relief of the people living in these areas.

**The Objectives of the Platform**
{: .text-center}

The project aims to identify disaster prone areas and map out possible mitigation
measures. During the time of a natural disaster such as flash floods, the
portal would make its data publicly available to the other relevant authorities
so that it can help them in expediting the process.
