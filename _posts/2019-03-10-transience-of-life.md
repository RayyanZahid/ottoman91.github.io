A case of bad flu can often send one to a trip down the rabbit hole of 
“thoughts-that-have-been-regularly-pushed-back-at-the-top-of-my-overfilled-mind.” 
I didn’t get much work done this weekend, and while mindlessly scrolling through 
my phone/laptop/tv in the midst of Monday Blues, I kept thinking about young 
people who have departed from this world. I did not personally know any of 
these people that well — at best, they were just random acquaintances at 
university. Now, a part of me wishes that I did know them well, that I had 
known a bit more about their dreams, fears, aspirations in life. I’m not sure 
what I would have done with this information. It’s just that, the idea that 
people who are in their youth can so suddenly disappear from this earth, is a 
bit jarring on some level.


We go through so many pre-defined motions every day. We tick off boxes from our 
daily to-do-lists, we have grand plans about what we want to achieve 1,2,5 years
from now, but the hard reality is that none of us have a guarantee on the actual 
time scale that we have to achieve all these things. When our reel of borrowed 
time finally ends, what happens to all the thoughts and plans that we had made 
for ourselves. Do they simply cease to exist, the output of hours of mental 
heavy lifting just disappearing into a non-existing ether? Or are they out 
there somewhere, part of the unified and invisible sub-conscious stream of 
thoughts, ideas, emotions and plans that is and isn’t a part of the collective
human experience? Nobody knows, and perhaps nobody ever will.

Every human being has or had aspirations at some points in their lives. What
happens when these aspirations aren’t realized? Further yet, are these 
aspirations even supposed to be realized? In our quest for wanting to change
the world and leaving our mark during our brief presence in this universe, 
are we missing out a crucial element on how we should be living and experiencing
life? I guess these questions will keep me up every night until I recover 
from my flu and am able to push them back to the long-term memory cache. I
hope those flu medicines do their magic soon.
